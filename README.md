# Frontend Testing with Cypress & React Testing Library.

A Todo Application done in React using Typescript. This is cloned from my exsisting [repo](https://github.com/Senthuran100/React-TypeScript) in github

Used Cypress for End to End testing and component testing using React testing library.

cypress/e2e/spec.cy.ts has the end to end testing and it test the basic flow like add todo item and delete todo.

This [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test) is a good point to start using cypress for end to end testing.

Component specific test cases are written using RTL. Added 3 component test for the main 3 components.
