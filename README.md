# React Typescript

A Todo Application done in React using Typescript..

Created a project using create-react-app with Typescript template.

`npx create-react-app React-Typescript --template typescript`

 The `store` folder contains following files which are related to redux.
* actionCreators.tx
* actionTypes.ts
* reducers.ts

`type.d.ts` contains the Typescript types.

`components` folder has the component files which are related to add Todo and display Todo list

!! Hope this will be a simple example to start out using <b>Typescript</b>  in React Application. !!
